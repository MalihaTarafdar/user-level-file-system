# User-Level File System
Unfortunately, due to unexpected, irrecoverable data loss, ULFS is no longer available. Both the source and its local backup have been lost. At this time, there are no immediate plans to rebuild this project from scratch, but I do plan to return to it sometime in the future. If you have any questions or would like to know more about the project, please do not hesitate to reach out.
